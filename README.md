# Post Reader 

Very simple app to get posts from JSONPlaceholder and parse them into a table.  Selecting a row shows the post in detail, grabbing the user's username from /users.  I built this after realising I have only ever used 3rd party frameworks to make HTTP requests and parse JSON, so thought I should look into how to do it natively using Swift 4's Decodable protocol.
